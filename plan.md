# Halo Project Implementation Plan

## Notes
- The project is a next-generation flight planning and navigation app for the African market, with both VFR/IFR support and AI-powered planning (Gemini integration).
- Four key documents guide implementation: PRD (`halo-prd-json.json`), technical specs (`halo-tech-specs.md`), wireframes (`halo-wireframes.html`), and high-fidelity UI (`halo-modern-ui.html`).
- The tech stack is React (web), React Native (mobile), Supabase (backend), Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and MapLibre GL JS.
- The MVP focuses on core planning, navigation, weather, aircraft profiles, and offline support for South Africa.
- All UI must match the design system and principles from the provided HTML files.

## Task List
- [x] Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
  - [x] Initialize React (web) and React Native (mobile) projects
  - [x] Configure Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and theme to match `halo-modern-ui.html`
  - [x] Set up Supabase backend, implement database schema and RLS from `halo-tech-specs.md`
- [ ] Phase 2: MVP Development
  - [x] Implement user authentication and profile management
  - [x] Develop aircraft management features (CRUD, limit 3 for basic tier)
  - [x] Flight Plan Management (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - [x] Full support for multi-leg flight plans
  - [x] Implement ICAO flight plan filing
  - [x] Implement moving map/navigation and migrate to MapLibre GL JS
     - [x] Replace Mapbox GL with MapLibre GL JS dependency
     - [x] Create new aviation-specific map component with OSM base tiles
     - [x] Add aviation overlays (Airspace, Airways, Navaids, Airports)
     - [x] Add weather overlays (Radar, Satellite) with toggle controls
     - [x] Implement custom map controls (Layer Toggle, Direct-To, Measurement)
     - [x] Implement flight route drawing (add waypoints by clicking)
     - [x] Implement flight route editing (drag waypoints, delete with context menu)
     - [x] Replicate OpenAIP UI/UX (Sidebar, Popups, Professional Styling)
   - [x] Integrate METAR/TAF weather and overlays (Initial implementation complete)
   - [x] Implement GPS tracking and "center on user" functionality
   - [x] Implement offline map support (tile caching via Service Worker)
  - [ ] Build UI for all main screens using structure from `halo-wireframes.html` and styles from `halo-modern-ui.html`
  - [ ] Develop REST API endpoints as per `halo-tech-specs.md`
- [ ] Phase 3: Premium & Advanced Features
  - [ ] Integrate Gemini AI assistant (chat UI, backend API)
  - [ ] Add advanced weather (turbulence, icing, trend analysis)
  - [ ] Integrate multi-source traffic and real-time updates (WebSockets)
  - [ ] Implement IFR features (approach plates, SID/STAR, etc.)
- [ ] Phase 4: Testing, Deployment & Launch
  - [ ] Write unit, integration, and E2E tests (coverage >80%)
  - [ ] Deploy web app (Vercel/Netlify) and mobile apps (App Store/Play Store)
  - [ ] Execute go-to-market and beta launch plan

## Current Goal
Build UI for all main screens using structure from `halo-wireframes.html` and styles from `halo-modern-ui.html`
